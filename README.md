MiniPi Joystick Driver
======================

This is a tiny driver written in Python using python-uinput
to emulate a driver from the French Minitel matrix keyboard.

This driver must be used with the (future) MiniPi v3.X adapter
board.

(This beta version includes dirty hacks from Adafruit MCP230XX
library in order to increase performance).
